This is a mod version of the classic "one chunk survival" experience except with the ability to expand the border slowly over time.

Here's a list of seeds I found interesting in that the beginning is possible, but challenging or just a seed with a cool spawn.

Interesting Seeds:

1.19.2:

6323281639556699871 - Often spawns you on ice, spawning at 63,62,0 provides a possible, but puzzling start.
8340635641313107006 - Spawns you in the middle of a mountainous jungle. Easy spawn.
3625487724323971260 - If you get lucky you will spawn above a cave and next to a lava pit (about a 1/8 chance)
